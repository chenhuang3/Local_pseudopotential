        REMARKS ON THE FHI PSEUDOPOTENTIAL PACKAGE fhi98PP [1]
        Revision of 28-06-2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Description and Copyright ---

a) Generate generalized norm-conserving pseudopotentials following the
   schemes by Hamann [2] or by Troullier and Martins [3] within common
   exchange-correlation schemes in density-functional theory.

b) Check the transferability of (these) pseudopotentials, in particular search
   for unphysical ghost states [4] of their fully separable (Kleinman-Bylander) 
   representation [5].

c) additional functionalities in a TEST STAGE are spin-polarized atom calculations
   and pseudopotentials for exact exchange calculations (generated within the
   KLI approximation, which should be very reasonable).

UNIX c-shell scripts "psgen" and "pswatch" should serve as command-line
interfaces to facilitate a) and b). They support output compatible with the
input format of the fhimd packages [6,7] and provide graphics output for the 
public domain XMGRACE graphics package. Use of the plain fortran programs 
"fhipp.x" and "pslp.x" is possible though less comfortable.

In its present from this package comes as it is used at the FHI. You are kindly
asked to critically inspect any input parameters and output, and to report any
bugs or inconsistencies you might encounter to the email address below. When
publishing results obtained with pseudopotentials based on this package please 
give proper credit as indicated below [1 - 5] and in the introductory comments
of the routines "fhipp.f" and "pslp.f". 

Use, copying, and redistribution of this software and its documentation is 
subject to license provisions as provided by the source from which you 
obtained this package. 

--- Guide to the directories ---

./bin/Elements ..... database of input files (do not use uncritically!)
./bin/Elements/Ham . for Hamann type pseudopotentials 
./bin/Elements/TM .. for Troullier-Martins type pseudopotentials 

./bin/Platform ..... makefile archive
                   
./bin/Xmgrace ...... header files for XMGRACE compatible graphics output
./bin/Tools ........ backup for shell scripts 

./src .............. fortran source files

./lib .............. archive of selected LAPACK routines (used as "libFree.a")
./lib/src........... fortran source files

./sample ........... sample run

./work ............. testing ground

./Dplay ............ hands-on tour's prepared playground w/ examples
./Dplay/play.ps .... a short hands-on tour of the package 
                   
--- Installation ---

a) Customize "Makefile" in "./src". You need to set compiler and linker flags
   compatible to your platform. Some linear algebra package is required, and
   you need to specify either use of the ESSL library or the libFREE library 
   (an excerpt of the LAPACK package put into "./lib").

b) If libFREE is used make should take automatically care of generating and
   linking this library. Alternatively go to "./lib" and create the archive 
   "libFree.a" using <make -f make.libFree>. Again you need to set appropriate 
   compiler flags in "make.libFree" first. 

c) In "/src" create the executables
   "./src/fhipp.x" ... pseudopotential generating by <make fhipp.x>
   "./src/pslp.x" .... pseudopotential generating by <make pslp.x>
   If linking the library fails, the respective syntax for linking in 
   the present "Makefile" might be incompatible with your platform. 
   Corrections shoud be straightforward, however linking the objects
   by hand is an alternative too.
   
d) Set appropriate paths for executables and graphics header files etc. in the
   shell scripts "psgen" and "pswatch" (stored in ./bin/Tools). This can be
   done by specifying the environment variable "FHIPP_PATH" which should point
   to the directory fhi98PP.
   For a list of the shell scripts' options enter <psgen -h> and <pswatch -h>.

e) Verify that you can reproduce the results of the sample run given in
   "./sample".
