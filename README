Program for generating high-quality local pseudopotentials for most metallic elements. 
The code is based on FHI98 program. 


Jobs are located in "jobs" directory. Input file for my code is "vlocal.ini" in these folders. 
To build LPSs, run ./psgen as usual first, and then run ./pswatch (which will read vloca.ini)


All LPS are in the "LPS_database" directory and are in ABINIT's format.
